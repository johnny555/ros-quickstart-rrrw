# Explorer Bot: Autonomous Maze Mapping Plan

This document outlines the step-by-step implementation plan for creating a TurtleBot4 control node that autonomously explores and maps a maze while detecting April tags.

## System Overview

- **Explorer Node**: Central control node orchestrating the autonomous exploration
- **NAV2 Stack**: Used for path planning and obstacle avoidance
- **SLAM Toolbox**: For simultaneous localization and mapping
- **April Tag Detection**: To identify and log April tag locations
- **Frontier Exploration**: Algorithm to efficiently explore unknown areas
- **RViz2 Visualization**: For monitoring exploration progress and April tag locations

## System Architecture

### Control Interface
- The exploration system will be implemented as a ROS 2 **Action Server** that provides:
  - Ability to start/stop exploration with specific goals
  - Feedback during exploration process
  - Final results upon completion
  - Cancellation capability
  
- The Action interface will define:
  - **Goal**: Target coverage percentage or time limit
  - **Feedback**: Current coverage percentage, tags found, exploration status
  - **Result**: Final map statistics, discovered tag locations, exploration success status

- An RViz2 panel will be developed to:
  - Provide GUI buttons to start/stop the exploration action
  - Display current exploration status and metrics
  - Allow parameter adjustment without restarting the node

### Component Interaction
- Explorer node will:
  - Subscribe to map updates from SLAM Toolbox
  - Process April tag detections
  - Identify frontier points
  - Send navigation goals to NAV2
  - Publish visualization markers for RViz2
  - Provide the action server interface

## Testing and Validation

Our testing approach emphasizes automated verification and quantitative metrics rather than manual observation. The comprehensive testing framework includes:

- **Unit Tests**: Individual component validation
- **Integration Tests**: Component interaction verification  
- **System Tests**: Complete workflow validation
- **Performance Tests**: Efficiency and resource usage measurement
- **Reliability Tests**: Extended operation and failure recovery

**Details:** See `testing_methodology.md` for details.

## User Interface

The system provides an intuitive RViz2 panel for exploration control and monitoring, featuring:

- Start/stop exploration controls
- Real-time progress indicators
- April tag discovery tracking
- System health monitoring
- Parameter adjustment interface

**Details:** See `rviz_control_interface.md` for details.

## Evaluation Framework

The explorer bot is evaluated using comprehensive metrics:

- **Coverage Efficiency**: Area mapped vs. time and optimal paths
- **Detection Accuracy**: April tag pose precision and reliability
- **System Performance**: CPU, memory, and real-time performance
- **Reliability**: Failure rates and recovery effectiveness

**Details:** See `evaluation_metrics.md` for details.

## Development Workflow

1. Implement stages sequentially with test-driven development
2. Write automated tests before implementing features
3. Verify functional correctness and performance metrics
4. Document implementation decisions and test results

## Success Metrics

The complete system should achieve:
- 80% maze coverage within 30 minutes
- >95% April tag detection rate within sensor range
- <5cm position accuracy for detected tags
- >4 hours continuous operation without failures
- Intuitive user interface requiring no training
