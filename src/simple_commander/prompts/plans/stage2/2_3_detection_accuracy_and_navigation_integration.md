# Stage 2.3: Detection Accuracy & Navigation Integration

This plan covers testing AprilTag detection accuracy and integrating detection with robot navigation.

## Objectives
- Validate AprilTag detection accuracy and reliability
- Integrate detection with navigation and exploration
- Ensure real-time performance during robot movement

## Implementation Details
### Detection Accuracy Testing
- **Test Scenarios**:
  1. Known position tags
  2. Distance and angle testing
  3. Lighting conditions
- **Metrics**:
  - Detection rate
  - Pose accuracy (meters, degrees)
  - Consistency (std. dev.)
  - Range
- **Test Implementation**:
  - Ground truth comparison
  - Automated robot movement and detection
  - Statistical analysis and logging
- **Performance Targets**:
  - >95% detection rate within 3m
  - ±5cm position accuracy within 2m
  - ±5° orientation accuracy

### Navigation Integration
- **Concurrent Operation**: Detection during movement
- **Motion Compensation**: Account for robot motion
- **Navigation Integration**: Share tag info with exploration
- **Optimization**: Balance detection frequency and load
- **Considerations**:
  - Motion blur
  - Processing load
  - Memory management
  - Real-time requirements

## Testing Criteria
- Tag detection works while moving
- Navigation performance unaffected
- Tag detection during maneuvers
- All automated tests pass
