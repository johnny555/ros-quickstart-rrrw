# Stage 3.1 & 3.2: Frontier Detection and Exploration Strategy

## Step 3.1: Frontier Detection Algorithm

### Task
Implement a robust frontier detection algorithm that identifies the boundaries between explored and unexplored areas.

### Implementation Details
- **Input**: Occupancy grid map from SLAM Toolbox (`/map` topic)
- **Algorithm**: Connected components analysis for frontier identification
- **Frontier Definition**: Transition zones between free space (occupancy < 0.2) and unknown space (occupancy = -1)
- **Filtering Criteria**:
  - Minimum frontier cluster size threshold
  - Accessibility check using navigation stack
  - Distance from robot position
  - Previous exploration attempt history

### Key Components
- **Grid Analysis**: Process occupancy grid to identify frontier cells
- **Clustering**: Group adjacent frontier cells into meaningful clusters
- **Centroid Calculation**: Extract representative points for each cluster
- **Accessibility Validation**: Ensure navigation stack can reach frontier points
- **Priority Scoring**: Rank frontiers based on exploration value

### Data Structures
- **Frontier Point**: Position, cluster size, accessibility score
- **Frontier Cluster**: Collection of connected frontier cells
- **Exploration History**: Previous attempts and outcomes for each frontier

### Testing Criteria
- **Test 1**: Unit tests with synthetic occupancy grids
- **Test 2**: Verify frontier detection in known maze environments
- **Test 3**: Confirm frontier updates as map expands

## Step 3.2: Exploration Strategy Implementation

### Task
Develop an intelligent exploration strategy that balances information gain with navigation efficiency.

### Implementation Details
- **Information Gain Calculation**:
  - Ray casting from candidate points to estimate visible unknown area
  - Count of unknown cells potentially observable
  - Weight by sensor range and field of view
- **Cost-Benefit Analysis**:
  - Navigation distance and time estimation
  - Path difficulty assessment
  - Previous exploration success rate
- **Selection Algorithm**: Choose optimal frontier based on gain/cost ratio

### Strategic Considerations
- **Exploration Efficiency**: Prioritize high-information areas
- **Navigation Pragmatism**: Avoid extremely difficult paths
- **Coverage Optimization**: Ensure systematic area coverage
- **Adaptive Behavior**: Learn from previous exploration attempts

### Multi-Objective Optimization
- **Primary Goal**: Maximize unknown area discovery
- **Secondary Goal**: Minimize navigation time and energy
- **Tertiary Goal**: Maintain systematic coverage pattern
- **Constraint**: Respect navigation stack capabilities

### Testing Criteria
- **Test 1**: Verify information gain calculations with mock environments
- **Test 2**: Test frontier selection in various maze configurations
- **Test 3**: Measure exploration efficiency compared to random walk
