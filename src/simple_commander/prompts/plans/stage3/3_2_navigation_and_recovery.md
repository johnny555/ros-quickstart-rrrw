# Stage 3.3 & 3.4: Navigation Integration and Recovery Behaviors

## Step 3.3: Navigation Integration

### Task
Integrate frontier exploration with the Navigation2 stack for autonomous movement to selected exploration targets.

### Implementation Details
- **Action Client**: Interface with NavigateToPose action server
- **Goal Management**: Queue and prioritize navigation goals
- **Feedback Processing**: Monitor navigation progress and status
- **Timeout Handling**: Manage navigation attempts that exceed time limits
- **Path Monitoring**: Track actual vs. planned paths for learning

### Navigation Workflow
1. **Goal Selection**: Choose next frontier based on exploration strategy
2. **Goal Validation**: Verify goal is still valid and accessible
3. **Navigation Request**: Send goal to Navigation2 stack
4. **Progress Monitoring**: Track movement and goal approach
5. **Completion Handling**: Process successful navigation or failures

### Adaptive Goal Management
- **Dynamic Re-planning**: Update goals based on new map information
- **Goal Cancellation**: Cancel goals that become invalid or unreachable
- **Priority Adjustment**: Modify goal priorities based on exploration progress
- **Backup Selection**: Maintain alternative goals for quick recovery

### Testing Criteria
- **Test 1**: Verify action client communication with nav2 stack
- **Test 2**: Test goal cancellation and re-planning scenarios
- **Test 3**: Measure navigation success rates to frontier points

## Step 3.4: Recovery Behaviors

### Task
Implement intelligent recovery behaviors to handle navigation failures and stuck conditions.

### Implementation Details
- **Stuck Detection**:
  - No progress toward goal for configurable time threshold
  - Oscillating movements without net progress
  - Repeated navigation failures to same destination
  - Low velocity despite clear goal commands

### Recovery Strategies
- **Rotation Recovery**: Rotate in place to gather additional sensor data
- **Backup Recovery**: Move backward to escape local navigation issues
- **Alternative Path**: Request different path from navigation planner
- **Goal Modification**: Adjust goal position slightly to avoid obstacles
- **Frontier Blacklisting**: Temporarily mark problematic areas as unavailable

### Recovery Sequence
1. **Detection**: Identify stuck or failure condition
2. **Classification**: Determine type of navigation problem
3. **Strategy Selection**: Choose appropriate recovery behavior
4. **Execution**: Implement recovery action with timeout
5. **Evaluation**: Assess recovery success and next steps

### Adaptive Learning
- **Failure Pattern Recognition**: Learn from repeated failure locations
- **Strategy Effectiveness**: Track recovery success rates by type
- **Parameter Tuning**: Adjust recovery parameters based on experience
- **Environment Adaptation**: Modify behaviors for different maze characteristics

### Testing Criteria
- **Test 1**: Simulate stuck conditions and verify recovery activation
- **Test 2**: Test each recovery strategy independently
- **Test 3**: Measure overall navigation robustness with recovery system
