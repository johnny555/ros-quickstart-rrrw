# Stage 1: System Integration Verification and Success Criteria

## Step 1.5: System Integration Verification

### Task
Create comprehensive integration tests to verify all components work together correctly.

### Implementation Details
- **Integration Test Suite**: `test/test_system_integration.py`
- **Test Coverage**:
  1. All required ROS 2 nodes are running
  2. Message flow between components
  3. TF tree is complete and updating
  4. Map generation is functioning

### Integration Test Framework
Create a comprehensive test suite `test/test_system_integration.py` that:
- Checks all required nodes are running (slam_toolbox, nav2 components, apriltag_node)
- Verifies topic publications with appropriate message rates
- Tests TF tree completeness and timing
- Validates map generation and updates
- Uses subprocess calls to `ros2` CLI tools for verification

## Success Criteria

At the end of Stage 1, the following should be functional:
1. ✅ Explorer bot package builds successfully
2. ✅ Launch file starts all required components
3. ✅ TurtleBot4 can navigate in simulation using manual goals
4. ✅ SLAM generates and updates map data
5. ✅ RViz2 displays all components correctly
6. ✅ All automated tests pass

## Next Stage
Proceed to [Stage 2: April Tag Detection](stage2_apriltag_detection.md) once all success criteria are met.
