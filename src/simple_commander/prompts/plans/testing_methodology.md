# Testing Methodology for Explorer Bot

This document outlines the comprehensive testing approach for the Explorer Bot system, focusing on programmatic verification and automated testing rather than manual observation.

## Testing Philosophy

Our testing approach emphasizes:
- **Automated Verification**: Tests that can run without human supervision
